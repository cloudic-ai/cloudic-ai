# Cloudic AI

When gazing into the sky, there's one thing that's hard to miss - the clouds. They come in all shapes and sizes and when looking at them, we tend to interpret them as all sorts of objects, be it tools, animals or even people. This quirk of human nature is known as the pareidolia effect. Inspired by it, we want to investigate if one can replicate it with images from space and weather artificial intelligence can be trained to experience it as well. For a more scientific implication of AI image analysis, we further aim to use AI to also classify the clouds scientifically. This is the code with does the analysis except the cloud detection with is implemented in the `iss-code-submission`.
